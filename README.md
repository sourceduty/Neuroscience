1. Neurodegenerative diseases: Conditions like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are becoming more prevalent as the global population ages. Developing effective treatments or interventions for these diseases is a pressing challenge.

2. Mental health disorders: The global burden of mental health disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia, is significant. Improving our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying these disorders and developing better treatments is crucial.

3. Neurodevelopmental disorders: Conditions like autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affect millions of individuals worldwide. Research into the causes and treatment of these disorders is essential.

4. Brain injuries: Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) and acquired brain injuries are major global health concerns, often resulting from accidents, sports-related injuries, or violence. Advancing our knowledge of brain injury prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation is vital.

5. Global mental health disparities: Many regions of the world lack access to adequate mental health care, leading to disparities in diagnosis and treatment. Research into culturally relevant interventions and strategies for addressing these disparities is needed.

6. Neuroinfectious diseases: Diseases like HIV/AIDS, Zika virus, and certain parasitic infections can affect the nervous system. Understanding the neurological consequences and developing treatments for these conditions is important.

7. Substance abuse and addiction: Substance abuse disorders, including those related to opioids, alcohol, and stimulants, have a significant impact on public health. Neuroscience research can contribute to understanding the neural basis of addiction and improving prevention and treatment.

8. Aging and cognitive decline: As the global population continues to age, there is a growing need to understand and mitigate age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging.

9. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs): The development and ethical deployment of BCIs for medical and non-medical purposes, such as communication for individuals with severe disabilities or enhancing cognitive abilities, raise important global issues related to privacy, consent, and regulation.

10. Ethical use of neurotechnology: Emerging technologies like neuroenhancement and neuromarketing raise ethical concerns about personal autonomy, privacy, and potential misuse. Developing ethical guidelines and regulations for these technologies is crucial.

11. Global mental health crises: Natural disasters, armed conflicts, and public health emergencies (e.g., pandemics) can have profound effects on mental health. Research on the psychological and neurological impacts of these crises and effective interventions is needed.

12. Access to neuroscience education and research: Ensuring that neuroscience education and research opportunities are accessible globally, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, is important for fostering a diverse and collaborative research community.

13. Neuroethics: The field of neuroethics addresses ethical and societal issues related to advances in neuroscience, including issues surrounding neuroimaging, cognitive enhancement, and the potential misuse of neurotechnology.
